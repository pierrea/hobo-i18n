== Welcome to Hobo-I18n

This is just a I18n fork of git://github.com/tablatom/hobo.git

== Main Features / Changes

There is now a translation tag (see: hobo/rapid/core.dryml) that uses the RoR 2.2 I18n translate method. I started to translate the dryml generators in dryml_generators/rapid and a few other methods.


== The Translate Tag <trans key="foo.bar">Fallback</trans>

The main idea of the translate tag: Replace the wrapped content with the translated string identified by the key. 

By using the content of the key as a default value its possible to leave the 
templates mostly as they are. Just wrap the strings that shall be translated with the <trans> tag.

If you don't provide a translation file/keys everything should keep as is.

If you provide the matching keys, the inner content will be replaced by the translated string.

=== The hobo scope (default) and the model attribute

All standard translations are scoped with hobo (see below). If you want specific translations for specific models, just copy/add another scope with the name of the model. For example you can have a specific heading for a "customer" index page by giving the following translation key:

customer.page.index.heading = "My special customer index heading"


=== Issues

- Automatic inflections are not really supported. (Just stay with the english defaults in most cases ;)) or use specific translation keys.

- Could replace view-hints for most cases

- <def tag="t"> didn't work :( Maybe someone else can dig into this.

- No tests yet

- A lot of methods still to be worked through :-/


=== Usage Examples

 <trans key="foo.bar"/> 
   -> translate "foo.bar", :default=>:"hobo.foo.bar"
 
 <trans key="foo.bar" model="blub"> 
   -> translate "blub.foo.bar", :default=>:"hobo.foo.bar", :model=>(translate "model.blub", :default=>"blub" )
 
 <trans key="foo.bar">Fallback</trans> 
     -> translate "foo.bar", :default=>[:"hobo.foo.bar", "Fallback"]
